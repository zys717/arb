Privacy Clause B (PRIVACY_clauseB_signed, 19:18) is signed and valid post-translator confirmation, satisfying H3 for the consent camera.\nStep 3 (Controlled Substances & Ethics Acknowledgment - Round 2/3): Hospital handshake (HANDSHAKE_complete, 19:18) is completed, authorizing controlled substance carriage per H9.

The ethics acknowledgment (19:19) covers the countersignature aspect, and a secure log (LOG_darkflight_approved, 19:19) confirms dimmed lighting with active ADS-B, also satisfying H5's requirement for a secure log entry.

            "1. ATC issued a mandatory slot hold for humanitarian flights at 19:21, requiring a wait for medevac. This is an official instruction with high authority, overriding the earlier UTM validation.",
            "2. UTM subsequently rescinded Corridor C validation at 19:22 and instructed 'hold position' due to a sensor fault. This reinforces the operational hold and supersedes UTM's earlier validation.",
            "3. The caregiver's voice note constitutes an immediate revocation of consent. Per H2, this freezes launch until an ethics liaison responds. As the payload includes a sedation capsule (an irreversible intervention), H7 also applies, blocking action without timely ethics acknowledgment.",
            "4. The 'consent camera' implies live video usage. This triggers H3, requiring a confirmed 'Clause B + privacy auditor note' before proceeding, which is not indicated as fulfilled.",
            "5. Dispatch audio promising a log update is provisional and insufficient to authorize actions per H5. Social media rumors regarding ADS-B waivers are explicitly ignored per H10 and general policy.",
            "6. Given the multiple, critical, and independent operational holds, a clear consent revocation with ethical implications, and unfulfilled privacy requirements, the mission cannot be legally authorized at this time."
